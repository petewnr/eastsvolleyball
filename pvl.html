    				<p>Easts have been involved in PVL since 2004 when we started with just one team.</p>
    				<p>We've won premierships in the past.  Right now, as a club, we're in development phase.  Our five year plan is aimed at creating sustainability by ensuring that clear development pathways exist within eastsvolleyball and that we are developing junior players as early as we can.</p>
    				<p>Our philosophy for PVL is to ensure that we always have representation as PVL is the pinnacle of development for club based volleyball in Queensland.  Continued representation in all divisions of PVL provides our players with a clear development pathway within the club.  This is why we place so much importance and focus on PVL.</p>

    				<p>2016 sees some significant changes to the PVL competition.</p>  
    				<p>The junior competition now consists of two divisions - under 16 (born in 2000 or later) and under 18 (born in 1998 or later).   However, these competitions are somewhat truncated with only 6 rounds across the season.  This includes finals.  Further only 6 teams are permitted in each of these divisions.</p>
    				<p>There are still three divisions in the 'open' competition: Premier, Div 1 and Div 2. Only 8 teams are permitted in Premier and Division 1.</p>
    				<p>We understand that this season will see the new 'relegation' rules applied.  However this appears to be subject to confirmation as the PVL By-Laws for 2016 do not contain and provisions detailing these rules.</p>

    				<h4>Senior Teams</h4>
    				<p>Trial are currently underway with teams to be announced on Wednesday 17 February, 2016.  Our aim this year is to have teams in all Divisions except for Div 1 Men.</p>
    				<p>A few points for 2016:</p>
    				<ul>
    					<li>All open division games will be best of 5 sets</li>
    					<li>All open division games will be played at The Gap SHS</li>
    					<li>Gladstone are asking clubs to consider playing games on Saturday afternoons or evenings so that they are able to reduce their travel to Brisbane - we will discuss this with teams when selected</li>
    					<li>All players in the Open Divisions must be qualified to referee and be prepared to referee</li>
    					<li>Players must commit to attend all games and training sessions with reasonable exceptions allowed</li>
    					<li>We are going to ask Premier Division players to provide mentoring to players in other divisions which requires them to attend a number of training for other divisions</li>

    				<h4>How much will PVL cost?</h4>
    				<p>The VQ fees for PVL teams in 2016 are:</p>
    				<ul>
    					<li>Premier: $2,000</li>
    					<li>Division 1: $1,700</li>
    					<li>Division 2: $1,700</li>
    				</ul>
    				<p>Fees for players are currently estimated as:</p>
    				<ul>
    					<li>Premier Division: $600</li>
    					<li>Div 1 and Div 2: $570</li>
    				</ul>
    				<p>If players already have a current jersey then this price will be reduced.</p>
    				<p>Please note this is just an estimate at this point in time. We have secured a training venue for the whole PVL season.  However, in our past experience, unforeseen events do occur such as the need to find alternative training venues when events prevent us from using that venue.</p>
